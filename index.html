					<!--- This is the main body of info for this page--> 
				<i>Five Nights At Freddy's</i>, first created in 2014, is a huge franchise that contains over <strong>10 games!</strong> This is a huge game franchise, and is popular mainly due to its intense lore and fanatic fandom. If you are interested in getting into FNAF, there are so many places to start! If I were you, I would begin learning about all of the FNAF characters. There are <strong>four main characters</strong> that change based on the particular game, but they are each built off of the same base. In this website, I am going to tell you about each of the main four, and will go into my favorite iterations of each character! </h2>

				<!--- This is the link for the assignment--> 
				<p> Before you enter the fandom, you should listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/l18A5BOTlzE?si=IrGla9JhY5dZqBgn">this song, the FNAF song by the living tombstone.<small>tm</small>!</a>! It is fundamental to the fandom as a whole!</p>

				<!---Has some strong text elements for the assinment-->

				<P>Before we begin, here is my <strong>personal ranking</strong> of the FNAF characters...</P>

				<d1>
					<!--- This both contained my designated list and some emphasized text--> 
					<dt> <em> Chica </em> </dt>
					<dd> Chica is my favorie animatronic! She is cool, sweet, funny, and of course, a girl. I love her so much!</dd>
					<dt> <em> Foxy</em> </dt>
					<dd> Foxy is totally the outcast of the group. He has a different style of attack, and is typically seperated form the rest of the animatronics. This trait makes him really stand out!</dd>
					<dt> <em>Bonnie</em> </dt>
					<dd> Bonnie is always the most aggressive animatronic. I like him a lot, and his iconic face may sometimes even overtake Freddy.</dd>
					<dt> <em>Freddy</em></dt>
					<dd> Although Freddy is the leader of the group, he's my least favorite. That is not to say I do not like him! He has a lot of charm, but he kind of relies on his varients to stand out.</dd>
