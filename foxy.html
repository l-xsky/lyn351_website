				<h2> Who is Foxy?</h2>
				<p> Foxy was initially one of the most popular FNAF characters. He has lost some popularity in recent times, but <strong>I still like him!</strong> Each of his variants is filled with personality, his original form is cool, and of course, he's a fox! He's also a pirate. That's sick.</p>
